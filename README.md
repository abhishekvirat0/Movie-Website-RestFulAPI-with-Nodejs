# Movie-Website-RestFulAPI-with-Nodejs
Movie Analyst aggregates and displays a list of the latest movie reviews by famous critics across the web. Users can view the latest movie reviews, learn about the critics that review them, and also see the publications that Movie Analyst has partnered with. Website administrators, who will have a separate website, can see and edit these pages, but also have access to reviews-in-progress so that they can prepare and approve reviews ahead of time.

## Auth0 API for authentication.
The REST-API can be called by anyone. Let’s fix this by securing our endpoints with Auth0. 
Auth0 makes user identity simple and recently they released a new feature to make securing API endpoints a breeze as well. 
If you don’t already have an Auth0 account, signup for a free account here. 
Once you’ve signed up, navigate to your Auth0 dashboard and click on the New Client button to create a new Auth0 application. 
For the client type, select Non-Interactive Client and name it MovieAnalyst Website. Click on the Create button to create the client.

## Creating a Client in Auth0

As this is a new feature that is still in beta, you will be prompted to enable the API functionality. You can do so by simply flipping the switch and a new menu option titled “API’ will be available. Click on this new menu option to continue.
